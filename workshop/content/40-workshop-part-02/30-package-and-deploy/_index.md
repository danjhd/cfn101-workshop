# Package and Deploy

So far, you have deployed CloudFormation templates using the Console. It is also possible to use the AWS CLI to deploy a CloudFormation template. In this chapter, you will use the AWS CLI to deploy a CloudFormation template.

CFN templates can refer to other files or artifacts. For example Lambda source code, a ZIP file, nested CloudFormation Template file, or an API definition for API Gateway. 
These files have to be available in S3 before you can deploy the main CloudFormation template.

In this chapter, you will learn how to package, validate and deploy a CloudFormation template using the AWS CLI.
